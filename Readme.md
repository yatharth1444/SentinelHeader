# 🛡️ Node.js Security Header & SSL Scanner

A powerful **command-line security scanner** built in Node.js that checks websites for **critical HTTP security headers**, **SSL certificate validity**, and gives **ready-to-use configuration fixes** for Apache, Nginx, and Express.js.

This tool is perfect for:
- Web developers securing their applications
- DevOps engineers auditing server configs
- Pentesters doing quick recon

---

## ✨ Features

- **Security Header Analysis**  
  Detects missing or weak headers from the “Big Six”:
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
  - `X-Frame-Options` (XFO)
  - `X-Content-Type-Options` (XCTO)
  - `Referrer-Policy`
  - `Permissions-Policy`
  
- **Weakness Detection**  
  Flags unsafe values like `unsafe-inline` in CSP, low HSTS `max-age`, or non-standard clickjacking settings.

- **Instant Fix Snippets**  
  Gives **exact copy-paste ready** configuration examples for:
  - **Nginx**
  - **Apache**
  - **Express.js**

- **SSL/TLS Certificate Expiry Check**  
  Warns if the certificate expires soon.

- **Single or Bulk URL Scanning**  
  Scan one target or a whole file of targets.

- **Color-coded Output** for easy readability.

##  Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yatharth1444/SentinelHeader.git
cd SentinelHeader
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. (Optional) Make it globally available:

```bash
npm link
```

Now you can run it anywhere as:

```bash
SentinelHeader --url https://example.com
```

---

## 📌 Usage

### Scan a single URL:

```bash
node index.js --url=https://google.com
```

or (if linked globally):

```bash
SentinelHeader --url https://instagram.com
```

### Scan multiple URLs from a file:

```bash
node index.js --file targets.txt
```

Where `targets.txt` contains:

```
https://example.com
https://another-site.com
```

---

## 📊 Example Output

```
Server: nginx/1.18.0
[+] SSL valid until Sat Sep 28 2024 (405 days left)

Security Headers Check:
[OK] X-Content-Type-Options: Correct nosniff
[Missing] Content-Security-Policy: Missing CSP — prevents XSS
   Fix (Nginx): add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self';" always;
[Weak] Strict-Transport-Security: HSTS weak — increase max-age & includeSubDomains
[OK] X-Frame-Options: Good X-Frame-Options
```

##  What I Learned From Building This

This project started as a simple "check some headers" script…
but quickly evolved into a **deep dive into real-world web security**.
Here’s what I learned:

1. **Importance of Security Headers**

   * How each header plays a role in preventing XSS, clickjacking, MIME-sniffing attacks, and privacy leaks.

2. **Server Fingerprinting**

   * Identifying servers via headers like `Server` and `X-Powered-By`.
   * How different server types (Nginx, Apache, Express) require different config syntax.

3. **TLS/SSL Basics**

   * How to inspect a site’s certificate, calculate days to expiry, and detect missing/invalid certs.

4. **Node.js CLI Development**

   * Using `commander` for argument parsing.
   * Using `ora` for interactive CLI spinners.
   * Using `chalk` for colorized, readable terminal output.

5. **Realistic DevOps Practices**

   * Giving **actionable** and **specific** fixes makes a security tool far more useful.
   * Respecting timeouts and redirects for robust scanning.

---

##  Future Improvements

* **Auto-detect server type** and show config fixes accordingly.
* **JA3 TLS Fingerprinting** to identify hidden server stacks.
* **Behavior-based detection** for customized error pages.
* **More header checks** like `Cache-Control`, `Pragma`, etc.

If you want, I can also **add an “Installation via npm” section** so people can `npx` your scanner without cloning the repo. That would make it even more user-friendly for GitHub.
